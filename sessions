Transforming CI Failures into Focused Debugging with Visual Studio Playlists and AI

Benjamin Michaelis

When a CI pipeline fails, developers often waste valuable time sifting through large test suites to identify the tests that need attention. In this session, I’ll introduce a tool I developed that automatically converts .trx test results into Visual Studio .playlist files directly within the CI pipeline. This allows developers to download the .playlist file from the CI pipeline and instantly start debugging locally, running only the tests that failed. A key part of developing this tool involved leveraging AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Microsoft Copilot to accelerate the process. These AI tools helped me quickly understand complex decompiled code, identify key differences between Visual Studio playlist versions, and iterate far faster than I could manually. I’ll demonstrate how AI can assist in the exploration phase, navigate lower-level details, and allow developers to focus on higher-value tasks, such as solving the core problem. By adopting similar AI-assisted workflows, you can speed up your own development, tackle complex problems more efficiently, and boost productivity in your projects.

Old API, New Tricks: Add MCP to Existing .NET REST Endpoints

Jonathan "J." Tower

Your existing .NET Web APIs have served you well—but what if they could do more with them in the era of AI? In this session, we’ll explore how to breathe new life into your existing ASP.NET Web API endpoints built with ASP.NET CORE by adding Model Creation Protocol (MCP) capabilities to them. We'll look at how the MCP C# SDK makes it simple to annotate your existing controllers, instantly transforming your REST endpoints into AI-powered services that can empower LLMs and agents. We’ll also compare this approach to a no-code approaches using Azure API Management. Finally we'll look at where both of these approaches fall short and are only a starting point for a good long-term MCP design. You can use then to jump start the process and then follow the path we outline together to evolve your APIs from technical plumbing to intelligent, task-focused tools that solve real problems using AI—all without starting from scratch.

DataMountain: .NET data warehousing that beats C++ performance

Mason Wheeler

Databases and high-end data processing are commonly thought of as the realm of "systems languages" such as C, C++, and Rust. Pansynchro Technologies is looking to change that. Our new data warehouse service, DataMountain, uses the .NET community's intense performance optimizations of recent years to their fullest, producing blazing-fast SQL results that even manage to edge out Clickhouse on their own benchmarks in some cases. This session will go over some of the tricks that went into building this system, and how we used .NET code generation, high-performance code such as Spans and Vectors, and some tricks that just don't exist in systems languages, to build a .NET data warehouse with top-tier performance.

Smatterings of F#

Matthew Watt

You're a C# developer and you love it. .NET is your bread and butter, and rightly so - C# and .NET are awesome! But did you know that .NET is more than just C# (and VB 🙂)? Have you heard of this little programming language called F#? Maybe you have, and you love it as much as I do. Maybe you have, but you've got C#, so why bother? Maybe you have, and maybe you really like the ideas, but you work in a "C# shop" and your team members just can't be convinced. Maybe you've never heard of F# at all! Whoever you are, I welcome you! In this talk, I hope to address everyone I have described. If you love F# as much as I do, you'll be inspired to keep finding ways to scratch that F# itch, however you can! If you are a C# fanatic, you'll see that different ways of thinking about programming can help you be better at the things you're already doing...and that there are useful tools outside of our beloved C# 🙂 If you're a secret F# admirer in a world of C# developers, you'll discover that to use F# effectively, you don't need the title of "F# developer" at work, nor do you need to convince everyone on your team that they should convert all their C# to F#. F# lawyers - you can rest! In this talk, we're going to look at the ways I use smatterings of F# here and there to scratch my itch - and give back to the community! - We'll look at my blog and how, though it is primarily Astro, I used F# to build a basic commenting system, as well as some other useful frontend components - all without having to completely convert everything! - We'll look at some of my open source contributions, which are proof that you don't need to do anything groundbreaking to get started. Bored? See some missing functionality or documentation in a library you use a lot? Get forking! I hope to see you there!

Carbon Aware Computing - Using .NET Open Source libraries for more sustainable applications

Aydin Mir Mohammadi

Modern software development must become climate-friendly and resource-saving. However, we don't have to reinvent the wheel, as Green Software Development design patterns already exist. After the “usual suspects” such as maximizing server utilization, minimizing memory and processor utilization and dynamic scaling, a paradigm shift is needed. Similar to the energy transition, the use of resources must be aligned with the supply of resources. This is the principle of carbon aware computing. One option is to shift plannable loads (tasks, jobs, batch processes) to times with a high proportion of renewable energy in the power grid (time-shifting). A different strategy is required for on-demand loads and scaling. Here, the application must adapt the supply and its functionality to the available resources. This process is called demand shaping. This talk will show how these patterns can be implemented with Open Source .NET Libraries - on prem, in the cloud with Azure PaaS or in Kubernetes and what options an application has to “shed” the load. We see CarbonAware SDK with life Open Data, Job-Sheduling with Hangfire, Powershell Commandlets for automation, Kubernetes Exporter for KEDA & Prometheus. All aspects will be addressed: How does scaling work, how can you limit it dynamically based on the CO2 intensity of the power grid and where do you get the prediction data from. And the whole thing with lots of live demos.

GitHub Actions DevOps Pipelines as Code using C# and Cake SDK

Mattias Karlsson

Build and release configuration as code has become the de facto approach for most continuous build and release solutions today. Most commonly, this is done through a custom task-based, debug-resistant domain-specific language using YAML or JSON files. But what if, instead of using a markup language, you could use a proper programming language with well-defined and documented control structures, flow statements like for, while, and do, and the full expressive power of C#? In this session, we will go step-by-step through how you can orchestrate your GitHub Actions build and release pipelines using C#, powered by the Cake SDK and the latest features of .NET 10. You will see how to test and debug your pipeline locally without the slow push-and-wait cycle for CI to fail or succeed. Using standard developer tools like VS Code, you can reuse the language skills your team already has, reducing friction and unnecessary context switching.

Nullable Reference Types: It's Actually About Non-Nullable Reference Types

Shawn Wildermuth

Isn't `null` the bane of many of a developer's life? Working with nullable data has always required some amount of understanding this third state of data. Recently, Microsoft introduced Nullable Reference Types to .NET developers and for many a long-term C# developer, the change was daunting. In recent iterations, Nullable Reference Types are now the default for new projects. But once you understand the reason to use Nullability, you'll see how it can simply your code and have to use less safeguards around your code. Instead of turning it off, let me show you why Nullable Reference Types exist and how they could make your code better.
